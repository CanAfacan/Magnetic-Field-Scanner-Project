# Magnetic-Field-Scanner-Project
This project uses an AMR sensor, an Allegro Hall Digital Switch, a joystick module, and a servo motor. The servo motor is controlled with the joystick and the sensors are attached to the handle of the servo motor. When Allegro Hall Effect Switch detects a high enough magnetic field it allows the AMR sensor to input data onto the 3D graph.
